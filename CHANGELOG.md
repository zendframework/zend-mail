- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mail/pull/28) and

  `ContentType` header to properly handle parameters with encoded values.
- [#11](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mail/pull/11) fixes the
  behavior of the `Sender` header, ensuring it can handle domains that do not
  contain a TLD, as well as addresses referencing mailboxes (no domain).
- [#24](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mail/pull/24) fixes parsing of
  mail messages that contain an initial blank line (prior to the headers), a
  situation observed in particular with GMail.
